# Image Editor

This is a simple Java program for an image editor that allows various image manipulation operations. The program uses the Java AWT and ImageIO libraries to read, process, and save images. Users can choose from a menu of operations, including creating a grayscale image, changing brightness, inverting horizontally or vertically, applying mosaic and Gaussian blur, transposing, and rotating the image.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image_Editor.git
   cd Image_Editor
   ```

2. **Compile and Run:**

3. **Invert Image Horizontally:**
   - Produces an inverted version of the input image horizontally.

4. **Invert Image Vertically:**
   - Produces an inverted version of the input image vertically.

5. **Mosaic Blur:**
   - Applies a mosaic blur effect to the image based on user-defined strength.

6. **Gaussian Blur:**
   - Applies a Gaussian blur effect to the image based on user-defined strength.

7. **Transpose Image:**
   - Transposes the input image.

8. **Rotate Image 90 Degrees Clockwise:**
   - Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.

9. **Rotate Image 90 Degrees Anticlockwise:**
   - Rotates the image 90 degrees anticlockwise.

10. **Print Pixel Values:**
    - Displays the RGB values of each pixel in the terminal.
